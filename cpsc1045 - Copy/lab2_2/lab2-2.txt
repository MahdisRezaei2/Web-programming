4a) the prompt() ask the user (prompt the user) in order to user enters (gives) the input which is the lucky number 
4b) it returns the lucky number that user enters
4b) the type of the unserInput is a string 
4d) it shows an alert box which tells the user what was the lucky number they entered 
5a) Math.random() produces random numbers 
5b) Math.round() rounds a number to the nearest integer 
5c) because in the third line Math.round always rounds the number to the nearest integer which by using Math.random the number that is produced is always between 0 and 1 so always the number is near to 0 or near to 1 so it will always be rounded to 1 or 0 and 0 and 1 are binary numbers 
5d) yes, it is possible because we can change the interval on the range that umbers are generated in for example we can write this let rawRandom =(Math.random()*10)+1; which gives us numbers from 1 inclusive to 10 inclusive or we can write let rawRandom =Math.random()*10 which give use random numbers between 0 inclusive and 10 exclusive
