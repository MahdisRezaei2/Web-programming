    <h6>Game Instruction</h6>
    <p  id="instruction"> To start the game you need to choose one of the type of the birds, also one type of the animal to follow (chase) you; after choosing bird 
        and the animal, click on the 'start Game' button to start. To win the game you need to go through all the circles with the bird, but you need to be careful that 
    the animal doesnt eat you. When you go through circles, it means you are eatting them and your scores will increase. The maximum score is 100, 
    if you get this maximum you will win. Hint: some circles cannot be eaten easily, you may need to go through them more than once and moving your mouse
     on them for seconds.
Also, on the top of the page there is an audio that you can play and stop it whenever you want.
Hint: to see all the page completely make sure that you scroll up and down completely.</p>
